<p>The most important thing is that cows give us milk. They are an essential source of milk for mankind. The milk given by cows helps us in staying healthy and strong. Milk has a lot of benefits which keeps various illnesses away. Moreover, it also enhances our immune system. The milk also produces a lot of products like butter, cream, curd, cheese and more.</p>

<p>Even the cow dung is used for many purposes. People use it as a really rich fertilizer. In addition, cow dung is also an efficient producer of fuel and biogas. Cow dung is also used as an insect repellent. Plus, people also use it as abuilding material and raw material for paper making.</p>

<p>Next up, we see how cow leather is the most widely used form of leather. People use it for making soles, shoes, car seats, belts, and more. The cow leather makes up for almost 60 to 70% of the world leather production.
    Thus, we see how almost everything of a cow is useful for mankind. We know it carries a lot of importance in the Hindu religion.</p>

    <p>However, in India, there are a lot of cows that are not taken care of. They are left to roam around on roads through which they get many diseases. They also get into accidents and lose their lives. People and government must take important measures to keep the cows in a safe place so they do not get harmed on a daily basis.</p>
